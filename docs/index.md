# OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories Working Group

The motivation of the working group is to focus on helping maintainers of software repositories, software registries, and tools which rely on them. It is both a forum to share experiences and discuss shared problems (for more information, see [Communication](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos?tab=readme-ov-file#communication)) as well as a place to publish content to benefit package repositories.

## Maturity Model

* [Principles for Package Repository Security](https://repos.openssf.org/principles-for-package-repository-security) - February 2024
  > A security maturity model for package repositories, for assessing current capabilities and roadmapping future improvements.

## Implementation Guidance

* [Crafting a Package Deletion Policy](https://repos.openssf.org/package-deletion-policies) - April 2025
  > Guidance for package registries adopting or revising a package deletion policy.

* [Trusted Publishers for All Package Repositories](https://repos.openssf.org/trusted-publishers-for-all-package-repositories) - July 2024
  > Guidance for package repositories in adopting Trusted Publishers to authenticate publishing from hosted build environments without using long-lived credentials.

* [Build Provenance for All Package Registries](https://repos.openssf.org/build-provenance-for-all-package-registries) - July 2023
  > Guidance for package registries in adopting build provenance to verifiably link a package back to its source code and build instructions.


## Proposals, Surveys, and Other Work

* [Build Provenance and Code-signing for Homebrew](https://repos.openssf.org/proposals/build-provenance-and-code-signing-for-homebrew) - July 2023
  > A proposal for introducing build provenance and cryptographic signatures to the Homebrew package manager.
This is a list of materials (surveys, documents, proposals, and so on) released by the [OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos).

* [The Package Manager Landscape Survey](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos/blob/main/survey/2022/README.md) - December 2022
  > A survey/landscape of different security mechanisms and features that are implemented across the different ecosystems as they pertain to security critical user journeys.
