OpenSSF Working Group on Securing Software Repositories

## Motivation

This working group is for and focuses on the maintainers of software repositories, software registries, and tools which rely on them, at various levels including system, language, plugin, extensions and container systems. It provides a forum to share experiences and to discuss shared problems, risks and threats.

## Objective

* Enable faster cross-pollination of existing ideas across ecosystems (including technical measures, infrastructure approaches, and policies)
* Act as a clearinghouse for new ideas that could benefit multiple ecosystems
* Enable maintainers to better align and coordinate policies and changes between different ecosystems
* Identify & escalate needs for infrastructure and assistance for shared tooling and/or services (to be filled by supportive or sponsoring organizations (such as the [OpenSSF](https://www.openssf.org/)))
* Develop methods for sharing data related to software repositories, software registries, and tools which rely on them
* Delegate solving particular problems and goals to subgroups or other workgroups as appropriate

The working group may create:

* Normative, non-binding recommendations on common schemas
* Descriptive documentation of experiences and best practices

### Antigoals

* The working group is not a governing body and does not create binding obligations on members
* The working group does not dictate technologies, tools or solutions, though members are free to recommend them to one another

## Current work

* Survey of OSS software repositories
* TBD

## Governance

We use the [securing-software-repos-wg](https://github.com/orgs/ossf/teams/securing-software-repos-wg) GitHub team.

The [CHARTER.md](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos/blob/main/CHARTER.md) outlines the scope and governance of our group activities.

This group is co-chaired by [Dustin Ingram](https://github.com/di) and [Zach Steindler](https://github.com/steiza).
